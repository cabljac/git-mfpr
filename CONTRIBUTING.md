   ```

## Coding Standards

- Follow the official [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Write meaningful commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Ensure all exported functions have documentation

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that don't affect the code meaning
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - Code change that improves performance
- `test:` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build:` - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci:` - Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore:` - Other changes that don't modify src or test files

Example:
```
feat: add support for custom branch patterns

- Allow users to specify custom branch naming patterns
- Add validation for branch names
- Update documentation with examples
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure cases

Example test structure:
```go
func TestFeatureName(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   InputType
        want    OutputType
        wantErr bool
    }{
        // test cases
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Add inline documentation for exported functions
- Include examples in documentation where helpful
- Keep documentation concise but comprehensive
